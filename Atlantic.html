                        The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean, connecting the Americas to Europe and Africa. It spans from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean near Antarctica, covering about 20% of Earth‚Äôs surface. The Atlantic has been a critical pathway for trade, exploration, and cultural exchange throughout history, playing a central role in shaping global civilizations.<br><br>

                        The ocean is home to diverse marine life, including whales, sharks, and various fish species, as well as coral reefs like those in the Caribbean. Its currents, such as the Gulf Stream, significantly impact global weather and climate systems. The Atlantic also features significant geographic landmarks like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an underwater mountain range where tectonic plates meet.<br><br>

                        The Atlantic's coastline includes famous features like the Amazon River delta in South America, the fjords of Scandinavia, and the sandy beaches of the Caribbean. Economically, it supports fisheries, shipping routes, and offshore energy resources. The Atlantic remains vital for global trade and environmental systems, linking continents and fostering connections among diverse cultures.<br></p>
