                        Africa is the second-largest and second-most populous continent, known for its extraordinary diversity in cultures, languages, and ecosystems. It spans from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the southern tip of South Africa, encompassing deserts like the Sahara, lush rainforests in the Congo Basin, and vast savannas. Africa is home to over 1.3 billion people and more than 3,000 ethnic groups, each with unique languages and traditions.<br><br>
