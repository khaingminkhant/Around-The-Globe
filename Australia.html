                        Australia is both a country and a continent, known for its unique wildlife, diverse ecosystems, and vibrant cities. Located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it is the world's smallest continent and the sixth-largest country by area. Australia is made up of the mainland, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It has a population of about 26 million people, with the majority living in coastal cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.<br><br>

                        The country is famous for its natural wonders, such as the Great Barrier Reef, the Outback, and iconic landmarks like Uluru (Ayers Rock). Australia's diverse ecosystems range from tropical rainforests to deserts, making it home to some of the world's most distinct animals, including kangaroos, koalas, and wombats.<br><br>

                        Australiaâ€™s history is deeply rooted in Indigenous cultures, with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples having lived on the continent for tens of thousands of years. Today, Australia is a highly developed nation, known for its strong economy, high quality of life, and outdoor lifestyle. It also plays an important role in global affairs, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.</p></th>
